Creative Portion:
- Vex API - Allows us to make popups that take user input and make new events with the desired submitted features.
- Custom event colors - users can set and change the colors of their events, if none defaults to a color, kind of like in the Outlook calendar.
- Event tags - users can set and edit the tag they set for the event (text). Can be null.
- Event location - users can set and edit the location of their event. Can be null.
- Greying out days in the calendar that aren't in the current month, but still display the events if there's any.
